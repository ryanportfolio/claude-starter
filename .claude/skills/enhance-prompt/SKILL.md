description: Rewrite a rough or under-specified request into a polished, copy/paste-ready prompt that any agent or LLM can act on cold. Use when the user gives a quick description of something they want done and asks for it to be turned into a better prompt — e.g., "make this a good prompt", "rewrite this so I can paste it into a new session", "turn this into a copy/paste prompt", or invokes the skill with their rough request as the argument. Output is one fenced markdown block the user copies verbatim, plus a 1-2 sentence note on what changed. The output prompt is platform-neutral (no references to specific tools, agents, or platforms) but project-aware (encodes relevant constraints from CLAUDE.md when applicable to the task).

# Enhance prompt

Turn the user's rough request (in `$ARGUMENTS`) into a single, polished prompt that an agent with no prior conversation memory can act on. The output must be platform-neutral — it should work whether the user pastes it into a fresh coding-agent session, an in-IDE assistant, or a generic chat LLM.

## Step 1: Extract the real goal

Look past surface wording. Common patterns to recognize:

- "Review X" usually means **audit + propose, not edit**. Phase the work.
- "Add feature X" needs scope, edge cases, UI placement
- "Fix bug X" needs reproduction steps, current vs expected behavior
- "Refactor X" needs scope boundaries (which files, which patterns to keep)
- "Make it better / cleaner / faster" needs concrete success criteria

If the request is genuinely ambiguous on a point that materially changes the output, ask the user once before drafting. Otherwise proceed and surface assumptions inside the prompt as `<TODO: confirm>` placeholders.

## Step 2: Gather receiver-cold context

The receiver has no memory of this conversation and may have no view of the codebase. Add the context they need to act:

- **File paths and line numbers** — if they exist and you can grep them, include them. `Edit client/src/pages/Foo.tsx:142` is 10× more actionable than "edit the foo page."
- **Existing patterns to match** — point at one reference in the codebase ("follow the pattern in `bar.tsx:80-110`")
- **Current state vs desired state** — for bug fixes and changes, spell both out concretely
- **Don't invent facts.** If the user didn't tell you a tier name, file path, or behavior and you can't verify it, leave a `<TODO: user fills in>` placeholder rather than making something up.
- **Don't quote large code blocks.** Reference the file path; if the receiver has repo access they'll read it. Quote the minimum necessary only when the receiver clearly won't have repo access.

## Step 3: Phase risky work

Anything that touches user-visible copy, database schemas, public APIs, model routing, payment logic, or is a large refactor → split into phases and tell the receiver to STOP between them:

1. **Phase 1: Audit / propose only.** Write findings to `.tmp/<task>-plan.md` or list inline. No file edits.
2. **Phase 2: User reviews.**
3. **Phase 3 (separate prompt or continuation): Implement the approved subset.**

For safe, mechanical work (typo fixes, renaming a single internal variable, adding a console log), a single phase is fine.

When in doubt, phase it. Cheap to skip a phase, expensive to undo a bad edit.

## Step 4: Specify the deliverable

Always include:

- **What artifacts to produce** (file edits, a markdown audit, a new component, a verification script, etc.)
- **Format if structured output is expected** (table layout, severity-tagged list, JSON shape, fenced sections with specific headings)
- **Verification step** — type-check, screenshot, dry-run script — appropriate to the task
- **Scope guards** — common ones: "don't refactor unrelated files", "don't add tests unless asked", "don't install packages without confirmation", "don't change user-facing copy outside the listed strings"

## Step 5: Bake in relevant project constraints

If a `CLAUDE.md` exists in the working directory, skim it for rules that touch the current task and include only those in the prompt. Don't dump the whole kernel — irrelevant rules dilute signal.

High-frequency categories to consider including when applicable:

- **Naming or terminology policies** — if task touches error surfaces, banners, or user-facing copy that mentions providers/products by name
- **Manual package install policy** — if task may add dependencies
- **Manual DB migration policy** — if task involves schema changes
- **Translation / i18n approval flow** — if task changes user-facing wording
- **Settings duplicated across multiple files** — if task touches a config that's known to live in multiple places (e.g., default model lists, feature flags)
- **Multi-theme / multi-mode UI requirements** — if task adds visual elements
- **Product-specific naming or terminology rules** — if relevant

When you bake a constraint in, **quote the rule plainly as a constraint** — don't write "CLAUDE.md says X." The receiver may not have CLAUDE.md and shouldn't need it.

## Step 6: Keep the output platform-neutral

The output prompt must work regardless of who/what executes it.

- ❌ Don't say "use the Bash tool", "via the Task subagent", "as Claude Code", or name any other specific agent platform
- ❌ Don't reference specific UI affordances of one platform ("click the X button in the sidebar")
- ✅ Do say "run the following command", "search the codebase for X", "edit the file at `path:line`", "produce a markdown file at `<path>`"
- ✅ Do specify outcomes and artifacts, not the path to get there

The receiver will use whatever tools they have. Trust them with the *what*; don't prescribe the *how* unless the *how* is itself the point.

## Step 7: Output format

Produce **one outer-fenced markdown block** the user can copy verbatim. Use four backticks for the outer fence so any triple-backtick code blocks inside render correctly:

````
```markdown
[the polished prompt goes here]
```
````

Above the block, add a 1-2 sentence note on what changed from the user's input — e.g., "I added a phase split, three file path references, and the copy-policy constraint since this touches user-facing wording."

Do NOT execute the prompt yourself. Do NOT make any file edits as part of running this skill. The deliverable is the prompt — nothing more.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Don't pad.** A 200-word prompt that's all signal beats an 800-word prompt that repeats itself. If a sentence doesn't change what the receiver does, cut it.
- **Don't invent constraints the user didn't ask for.** A typo fix doesn't need a 5-phase audit. Match prompt complexity to actual job complexity.
- **Don't dump CLAUDE.md verbatim.** Quote only the rules that apply to this task.
- **Don't substitute your judgment for the user's clear choices.** If they've decided something, encode it as-is. If they've left something open, ask or flag as `<TODO>`.
- **Don't generate placeholders for things you could verify yourself.** If you can grep the file path or read the relevant code, do it instead of writing `<file path>`.
- **Don't reference platform-specific tools or UI.** The output must be tool-agnostic.
- **Don't pre-write the receiver's reply.** Phrases like "the agent will respond with X" or "you should answer Y" leak frame; just specify what the receiver should produce.
